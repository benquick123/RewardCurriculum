# Curriculum Learning Algorithms for Reward Weighting in a Sparse Reward Robotic Manipulation Tasks

This repository is an official implementation of the paper *Curriculum Learning Algorithms for Reward Weighting in a Sparse Reward Robotic Manipulation Tasks*. It consists of two branches, `master` and `paper`. The former implements additional experimental in possibly broken features, while the latter reflects the code used for experiments in the paper and some additional documentation.
